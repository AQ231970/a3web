        <h2>Project Background</h2>
        <p>
          GEOM99 Web group 5 has been diligently working on a web solution for
          what has been an ongoing tracking issue for emergency response teams
          all over the country for decades: the tracking and geovisualisation of
          addresses. Addresses data is not as simple as it may seem—the need for
          more technological applications that hold more and more varying types
          of data in easy to access formats is growing every year. Web 5 has
          enveavoured to create a web solution for the tracking and mapping of
          more in-detail address information, like entrances and exits, and
          specifically to map addresses that may not be conventional or easily
          identified or reached.

                <p>
                  It is currently difficult to determine hidden addresses. This
                  makes it difficult for EMS services to provide help to
                  unidentified locations requiring them to use valuable time to
                  search for a unit.

                  <p>
                    Use a survey web application to record user reported hidden
                    address data. This information can then be transferred to a
                    database and allows city workers to confirm the reporting’s
                    before updating their own database.
