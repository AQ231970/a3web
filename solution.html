            In alignment with our methodology. We created a solution that has both a data collection component and a data visualization aspect. We created a survey that allows for individuals to report/record hidden address information.
            This survey format is like a form of citizen science. Since it’s difficult to find these hidden addresses for various reasons there is no cookie cutter method that can be used. Instead citizen science allows individuals to 
            send in reports if they believe an address is misrecorded.

          <p>
Next Steps 
The Survey’s quality assurance and quality control could be improved. For example: more restrictions for the fields e.g. letters only. Also further formatting of the address field so the first letter of a word is always capitalized. 
Webhooks can be created to send notifications via email or SMS to individuals that are responsible for certain areas (e.g. wards). This ensures that a municipality employee is aware when a new location is submitted and allows a spreadsheet to keep up with follow up. 
Explore open source options. While ESRI products are widely used it is not guaranteed because of the cost associated with the licenses so exploring other options that are more accessible can widen the application of this type of solution
